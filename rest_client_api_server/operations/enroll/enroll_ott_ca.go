/* EnrollOttCa swagger:route POST /enroll/ottca Enroll enrollOttCa

Enroll an identity via one-time-token with a pre-exchanged client certificate

Enroll an identity via a one-time-token that also requires a pre-exchanged client certificate to match a
Certificate Authority that has been added and verified (See POST /cas and POST /cas{id}/verify). The client
must present a client certificate signed by CA associated with the enrollment. This enrollment is similar to
CA auto enrollment except that is required the identity to be pre-created.

As the client certificate has been pre-exchanged there is no CSR input to this enrollment method.
